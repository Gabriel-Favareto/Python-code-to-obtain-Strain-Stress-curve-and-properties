# Pyhton code to obtain Strain-Stress curve and properties 

This project started with the necessity to automate the process of plotting Strain-Stress curves and obtaining the properties of the material tested on the universal testing machine, more specifically metallic materials.

## Introduction
This project is an application that, firstly, reads the text file obtained from the universal testing machine (example of the text file that 
the code was based on at the index), extracting the data and other necessary elements (area and gauge lenght). Secondly, using 
Pandas, the code will return the UTS (Ultimate Tensile Strength)
